# Team 5 - Application Tracking System (ATS)

This project is an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** that assists users in evaluating their resumes against a job description. It leverages the **OpenAI GPT model** to assess resumes by comparing them to job descriptions, providing a percentage match, identifying relevant keywords, and offering tailored recommendations for improvement. This project is developed using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **PDF Resume Upload**: Users can upload their resume in PDF format for analysis.
- **Job Description Matching**: The application compares the uploaded resume with a job description (optional) and calculates a percentage match.
- **Keyword Matching**: Identifies matching and missing keywords between the resume and job description.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Provides a detailed breakdown of resume content, including missing keywords and a percentage match score.
- **Recommendations for Improvement**: Tailored suggestions to improve the resumeâ€™s match with the job description.
- **Lottie Animations**: Provides an engaging user experience through Lottie animations.
  
## How It Works

1. **Upload Resume**: Users can upload their resume in PDF format through the interface.
2. **Input Job Description**: Users may provide a job description to compare the resume against. This step is optional.
3. **Analyze Resume**: Once the resume is uploaded and submitted, the system processes the resume using the OpenAI GPT model, returning:
   - Percentage match between the resume and job description.
   - List of matching keywords from the resume and job description.
   - List of missing keywords.
   - Profile summary.
   - Suggestions for improvement.
4. **Result Display**: The result is shown on the screen in an easy-to-read format with visual indicators for success or errors.

- **Improve their resume** by aligning it better with job descriptions.
- **Job seekers** who want to optimize their applications for specific roles in competitive industries like software engineering, data science, data analytics, and big data engineering.
